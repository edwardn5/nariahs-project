This project demonstrates skills in:
- API integration  
- CLI design using `argparse`  
- Automated testing with `pytest`  
- Mocking external API calls  
- CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions  
- AI-assisted development practices  

Perfect for showcasing practical software engineering and real-world development workflows.
